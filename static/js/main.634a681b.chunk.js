I was introduced to Scratch, a programming language for young children, and I feel in love with it.

I enjoyed playing around with both Scratch and Mindstorms, and I started to develop an interest in programming and robotics."),r.a.createElement(I.a,{varient:"p"},"In middle school, I joined our FTC team where I was exposed to the next level of robots. It was also around then I started learning how to play trombone. In high school, I got to join our FRC team, where I learned my first real programming language, Java. My freshman and sophmore years we're filled with learning about Java and learning about programming the robot. In my Junior and Senior years I finally started making significant contributions. I wrote significant amounts of the code that drove the robot and controlled it during the autonomous period. Below are two pictures of me at robotics competitions, the left picture shows the drive team at a district competition we won, and the right shows a picture of me driving the robot at an off season competition. Additionally in high school, playing trombone was a big part of my life. I was in marching band for 4 years and in pit orchestra for 3 years. Finally, during my senior year I had the opportunity to play with some fantastic groups. I auditioned for All-State ensembles and was selected as the first chair trombone player for the All-State Band. I also made it into the Michigan Youth Arts Honors Orchestra. Both of these groups are filled with the best high school musicians and it was an amazing experience to play with them."),r.a.createElement(I.a,{varient:"p"},"I graduated high school in May 2019 and entered the University of Michigan the following fall to study computer science.
